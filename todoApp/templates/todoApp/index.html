    <h3 style="text-align: center">'AjkeKiKorbo' is an app that lets you plan your day(and the next) and help you achieve your goals by keeping track of the tasks that
        you complete and the tasks that are yet to be completed.

    <h3 style="text-align: center">
        You can generalize this as a 'todo' app. However, what makes this better is 
        that this app can track your progress and let you see how you've been doing. There is a reminder feature as well, where you can have 
        as many reminders as you want and the app will show them to you in various pages in a random order. There are some other features as 
        well but they are for you to find out and hopefully more features will be available in the future.
